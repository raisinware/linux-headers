linux-headers
=============
Raw Linux Kernel userspace headers, automatically fetched by Github Actions.
The script used to fetch the kernel and export the headers is under 
`0BSD <OBSD>`_, while the actual headers are under their original licenses
(mostly ``GPL-2.0-only WITH Linux-syscall-note``)

.. _OBSD: https://spdx.org/licenses/0BSD.html
